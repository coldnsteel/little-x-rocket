#👨‍💻 Developer Story
This project represents a 45-year coding journey:
	•	1980: Filed first computer-generated legal brief in San Francisco
	•	1980: Pioneered computer education on Pacifica Cable TV
	•	2024: Returned to coding after decades, building dreams instead of databases
	•	2025: Launched this cosmic adventure with AI assistance
"Sometimes you need the right project to fall in love with coding again."

#🌟 Philosophy
Little X represents the wonder we all carry within us - the curiosity that makes us explorers, dreamers, and builders of impossible things. ARIA embodies the potential for AI and humans to be creative partners, not just tools and users.
Every adventure begins with a single step... or in this case, touching a mysterious purple rocket.
